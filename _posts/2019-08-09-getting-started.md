## Prerequisites

Follow the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll` and `Bundler`.

## Installation

There are two ways to get the theme:

- **Install from RubyGems** - Easy to update, isolate irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.
- **Fork on GitHub** - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to update, only suitable for web developers.

### Installing the Theme Gem

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-chirpy"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-chirpy
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Finally, copy the required files from the theme's gem (for detailed files, see [starter project][starter]) to your Jekyll site.

> **Hint**: To locate the installed themeâ€™s gem, execute:
>
> ```console
> $ bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy
> ```

1. Removes some files or directories from your repository:

    - `.travis.yml`
    - files under `_posts`
    - folder `docs`

### Fork on GitHub

[Fork **Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork) on GitHub and then clone your fork to local. (Please note that the default branch code is in development.  If you want the blog to be stable, please switch to the [latest tag](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/tags) and start writing.)

Install gem dependencies by:

```console
$ bundle
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bash tools/init.sh
```

> **Note**: If you don't plan to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append parameter option `--no-gh` at the end of the above command.

What it does is:

1. Remove some files or directories from your repository:
    - `.travis.yml`
    - files under `_posts`
    - folder `docs`

2. If you use the `--no-gh` option, the directory `.github` will be deleted. Otherwise, setup the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension `.hook` of `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook`, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder `.github`.

3. Automatically create a commit to save the changes.

## Usage

### Configuration

Update the variables of `_config.yml` as needed. Some of them are typical options:

- `url`
- `avatar`
- `timezone`
- `lang`

### Running Local Server

You may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll s
```

Or run the site on Docker with the following command:

```terminal
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll serve
```

Open a browser and visit to _<http://localhost:4000>_.

### Deployment

Before the deployment begins, checkout the file `_config.yml` and make sure the `url` is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the [**project site**](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites) and don't use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than **GitHub Pages**, remember to change the `baseurl` to your project name that starting with a slash, e.g, `/project-name`.

Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.

#### Deploy on GitHub Pages

For security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on `safe` mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use **GitHub Actions** to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GH Pages service.

Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build:

- Ensure your Jekyll site has the file `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml`. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the [workflow file][workflow], and the value of the `on.push.branches` should be the same as your repo's default branch name.
- Ensure your Jekyll site has file `tools/test.sh` and `tools/deploy.sh`. Otherwise, copy them from this repo to your Jekyll site.

And then rename your repository to `<GH-USERNAME>.github.io` on GitHub.

Now publish your Jekyll site by:

1. Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named `gh-pages` will appear to store the built site files.

2. Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab _Settings_, then click _Pages_ in the left navigation bar, and then in the section **Source** of _GitHub Pages_, select the `/(root)` directory of branch `gh-pages` as the [publishing source][pages-src]. Remember to click <kbd>Save</kbd> before leaving.
  ![gh-pages-sources](/posts/20190809/gh-pages-sources.png){: width="850" height="153" }

3. Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub.

#### Deploy on Other Platforms

On platforms other than GitHub, we cannot enjoy the convenience of **GitHub Actions**. Therefore, we should build the site locally (or on some other 3rd-party CI platform) and then put the site files on the server.

Go to the root of the source project, build your site by:

```console
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

Or build the site with Docker by:

```terminal
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll build
```

Unless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder `_site` of the project's root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server.

### Upgrading

It depends on how you use the theme:

- If you are using the theme gem (there will be `gem "jekyll-theme-chirpy"` in the `Gemfile`), editing the `Gemfile` and update the version number of the theme gem, for example:

  ```diff
  - gem "jekyll-theme-chirpy", "~> 3.2", ">= 3.2.1"
  + gem "jekyll-theme-chirpy", "~> 3.3", ">= 3.3.0"
  ```
  {: .nolineno file="Gemfile" }

  And then execute the following command:

  ```console
  $ bundle update jekyll-theme-chirpy
  ```

  As the version upgrades, the critical files (for details, see the [Startup Template][starter]) and configuration options will change. Please refer to the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki/Upgrade-Guide) to keep your repo's files in sync with the latest version of the theme.

- If you forked from the source project (there will be `gemspec` in the `Gemfile` of your site), then merge the [latest upstream tags][latest-tag] into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade.
The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts.
