__Hey, that's me!__

Hi! I'm lolrepeatlol (he/him). I'm literally just a giraffe on the Internet who's interested in a variety of topics, but my most notable interest is in the Internet and how Big Tech affects it, and that's been the case for quite a while now. 

I made this blog partially because I found myself repeating the same points to people online whenever they said a common thing I disagreed with. That got tiring really quickly, honestly. I felt that a blog would be a more effective way of getting my point out there -- and hey, when someone's commenting something I don't really agree with, I can just send a link to the post that states what I believe.

Thanks for stopping by!
